# Apple Web

This high-fidelity frontend project is a technical reproduction of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro website, developed following a tutorial by the YouTube channel JavaScript Mastery. Built using ReactJS and ViteJS, and deployed on Vercel, it showcases advanced web development capabilities focused on visual fidelity and complex interactions driven by animation and 3D graphics. The implementation utilizes GSAP (GreenSock) for sophisticated custom animations, including scroll triggers, staggers, and detailed timeline management. Furthermore, the project integrates ThreeJS to render and animate interactive 3D models with dynamic lighting and viewports. The interface features a custom video slider with progress tracking and is styled using TailwindCSS to ensure complete responsiveness and optimal performance across all devices.
